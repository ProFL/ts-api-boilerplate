This is the suggested folder for you to place your docker secrets.

It's common sense not to upload those to git, unless you're absolutely sure of
what you are doing.

In this boilerplate, samples are provided only for the sake of simplicity, but
you MUST change them in order to use this in production.

Secrets are a nice and safe docker way to spread files across your swarm
production environment, see more at the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/)
