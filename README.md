# TypeScript API Code Boilerplate

This project stands to be a ready to use TypeScript boilerplate
for an API project, set up with TypeORM as the ORM, eslint and prettier to
enforce beautiful standardized code, express to support connect style
middlewares, reduce the hassle of http handling and ease extension,
passport.js set up for authentication with passport-jwt all created with TDD
and jest ready setup.
